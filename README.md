** PROJECT PING PONG **

*** This is an assignment to practice writing code with arrays and looping. The idea is that, given an input number, the program will count to that number, substituting multiples of 3 and 5 with the words "ping" and "pong" respectively, and multiples of 15 with the word "ping pong." Sure hope it works! ***

** INSTRUCTIONS **
Enter a number. Watch it go!
