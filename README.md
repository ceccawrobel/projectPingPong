# PROJECT PING PONG
viewable [here](http://ceccawrobel.github.io/projectPingPong), courtesy github pages

## INSTRUCTIONS
Enter a number. Watch it go!

## DESCRIPTION
This is an assignment to practice writing code with arrays and looping. The idea is that, given an input number, the program will count to that number, substituting multiples of 3 and 5 with the words "ping" and "pong" respectively, and multiples of 15 with the word "ping pong."

The assignment is for our "arrays and looping" unit, so I assume that practice with arrays was an intended objective. That said, I created my page without arrays.

## SPECIFICATIONS
1. Program provides list up to the user-given number
* example input: 2
* example output: [1, 2]
2. Program substitutes multiples of 3 with the word "ping"
* example input: 3
* example output: [1, 2, "ping"]
3. Program substitutes multiples of 5 with the word "pong"
* example input: 5
* example output: [1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong"]
4. Program substitutes multiples of 3 and 5 (i.e., 15) with "ping pong"
* example input: 15
* example output: [1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", "ping", 7, 8, "ping", "pong", 11, "ping", 13, 14, "ping pong"]
