** PROJECT PING PONG **

*** This is an assignment to practice writing code with arrays and looping. The idea is that, given an input number, the program will count to that number, substituting multiples of 3 and 5 with the words "ping" and "pong" respectively, and multiples of 15 with the word "ping pong." Sure hope it works! ***

** INSTRUCTIONS **
Enter a number. Watch it go!

** SPECIFICATIONS **
1. Program provides list up to the user-given number
* example input: 2
* example output: [1, 2]
2. Program substitutes multiples of 3 with the word "ping"
* example input: 3
* example output: [1, 2, "ping"]
3. Program substitutes multiples of 5 with the word "pong"
* example input: 5
* example output: [1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong"]
4. Program substitutes multiples of 3 and 5 (i.e., 15) with "ping pong"
* example input: 15
* example output: [1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", "ping", 7, 8, "ping", "pong", 11, "ping", 13, 14, "ping pong"]
